## 👋💻 Welcome to my GitHub!
I am Satyam Porwal. Currently, I am a BCA 3rd year student at IIMT University (Meerut). I have keen interest in coding with Python and develop web pages. I have done my project on travel and tourism website, Alexa voice assistance and Attendance marking system. Now, I am looking forward for an internship as a software developer.
